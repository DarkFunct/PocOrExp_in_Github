## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2021-40114
 Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability in the way the Snort detection engine processes ICMP traffic that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper memory resource management while the Snort detection engine is processing ICMP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of ICMP packets through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust resources on the affected device, causing the device to reload.

## CVE-2021-34749
 A vulnerability in Server Name Identification (SNI) request filtering of Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA), Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and the Snort detection engine could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass filtering technology on an affected device and exfiltrate data from a compromised host. This vulnerability is due to inadequate filtering of the SSL handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using data from the SSL client hello packet to communicate with an external server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute a command-and-control attack on a compromised host and perform additional data exfiltration attacks.

## CVE-2021-1224
 Multiple Cisco products are affected by a vulnerability with TCP Fast Open (TFO) when used in conjunction with the Snort detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass a configured file policy for HTTP.

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TFO packets with an HTTP payload through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured file policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.

## CVE-2012-5613
 ** DISPUTED ** MySQL 5.5.19 and possibly other versions, and MariaDB 5.5.28a and possibly other versions, when configured to assign the FILE privilege to users who should not have administrative privileges, allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges by leveraging the FILE privilege to create files as the MySQL administrator. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that this is only a vulnerability when the administrator does not follow recommendations in the product's installation documentation. NOTE: it could be argued that this should not be included in CVE because it is a configuration issue.

## CVE-2012-2658
 ** DISPUTED ** Buffer overflow in the SQLDriverConnect function in unixODBC 2.3.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long string in the DRIVER option. NOTE: this issue might not be a vulnerability, since the ability to set this option typically implies that the attacker already has legitimate access to cause a DoS or execute code, and therefore the issue would not cross privilege boundaries. There may be limited attack scenarios if isql command-line options are exposed to an attacker, although it seems likely that other, more serious issues would also be exposed, and this issue might not cross privilege boundaries in that context.

## CVE-2012-2129
 Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in doku.php in DokuWiki 2012-01-25 Angua allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the target parameter in an edit action.

## CVE-2012-2128
 ** DISPUTED ** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in doku.php in DokuWiki 2012-01-25 Angua allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that add arbitrary users. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, who states that it is resultant from CVE-2012-2129: &quot;the exploit code simply uses the XSS hole to extract a valid CSRF token.&quot;

## CVE-2012-0039
 ** DISPUTED ** GLib 2.31.8 and earlier, when the g_str_hash function is used, computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table. NOTE: this issue may be disputed by the vendor; the existence of the g_str_hash function is not a vulnerability in the library, because callers of g_hash_table_new and g_hash_table_new_full can specify an arbitrary hash function that is appropriate for the application.

## CVE-2011-4858
 Apache Tomcat before 5.5.35, 6.x before 6.0.35, and 7.x before 7.0.23 computes hash values for form parameters without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted parameters.

## CVE-2011-3640
 ** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS), as used in Google Chrome before 17 on Windows and Mac OS X, might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse pkcs11.txt file in a top-level directory. NOTE: the vendor's response was &quot;Strange behavior, but we're not treating this as a security bug.&quot;

## CVE-2011-2906
 ** DISPUTED ** Integer signedness error in the pmcraid_ioctl_passthrough function in drivers/scsi/pmcraid.c in the Linux kernel before 3.1 might allow local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or memory corruption) via a negative size value in an ioctl call. NOTE: this may be a vulnerability only in unusual environments that provide a privileged program for obtaining the required file descriptor.

## CVE-2010-2532
 ** DISPUTED ** lxsession-logout in lxsession in LXDE, as used on SUSE openSUSE 11.3 and other platforms, does not lock the screen when the Suspend or Hibernate button is pressed, which might make it easier for physically proximate attackers to access an unattended laptop via a resume action. NOTE: there is no general agreement that this is a vulnerability, because separate control over locking can be an equally secure, or more secure, behavior in some threat environments.

## CVE-2009-3559
 ** DISPUTED ** main/streams/plain_wrapper.c in PHP 5.3.x before 5.3.1 does not recognize the safe_mode_include_dir directive, which allows context-dependent attackers to have an unknown impact by triggering the failure of PHP scripts that perform include or require operations, as demonstrated by a script that attempts to perform a require_once on a file in a standard library directory. NOTE: a reliable third party reports that this is not a vulnerability, because it results in a more restrictive security policy.

## CVE-2008-2956
 ** DISPUTED ** Memory leak in Pidgin 2.0.0, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via malformed XML documents. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the upstream vendor, who states: &quot;I was never able to identify a scenario under which a problem occurred and the original reporter wasn't able to supply any sort of reproduction details.&quot;
