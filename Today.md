## CVE-2022-22978
 In Spring Security versions 5.5.6 and 5.6.3 and older unsupported versions, RegexRequestMatcher can easily be misconfigured to be bypassed on some servlet containers. Applications using RegexRequestMatcher with `.` in the regular expression are possibly vulnerable to an authorization bypass

## CVE-2022-1119
 The Simple File List WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Arbitrary File Download via the eeFile parameter found in the ~/includes/ee-downloader.php file due to missing controls which makes it possible unauthenticated attackers to supply a path to a file that will subsequently be downloaded, in versions up to and including 3.2.7.

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2021-4034
 A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's pkexec utility. The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by crafting environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the attack can cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users administrative rights on the target machine.

## CVE-2021-3493
 The overlayfs implementation in the linux kernel did not properly validate with respect to user namespaces the setting of file capabilities on files in an underlying file system. Due to the combination of unprivileged user namespaces along with a patch carried in the Ubuntu kernel to allow unprivileged overlay mounts, an attacker could use this to gain elevated privileges.

## CVE-2019-19356
 Netis WF2419 is vulnerable to authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) as root through the router Web management page. The vulnerability has been found in firmware version V1.2.31805 and V2.2.36123. After one is connected to this page, it is possible to execute system commands as root through the tracert diagnostic tool because of lack of user input sanitizing.
