## CVE-2023-48031
 OpenSupports v4.11.0 is vulnerable to Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type. In the comment function, an attacker can bypass security restrictions and upload a .bat file by manipulating the file's magic bytes to masquerade as an allowed type. This can enable the attacker to execute arbitrary code or establish a reverse shell, leading to unauthorized file writes or control over the victim's station via a crafted file upload operation.

## CVE-2023-20198
 Cisco is providing an update for the ongoing investigation into observed exploitation of the web UI feature in Cisco IOS XE Software. We are updating the list of fixed releases and adding the Software Checker. Our investigation has determined that the actors exploited two previously unknown issues. The attacker first exploited CVE-2023-20198 to gain initial access and issued a privilege 15 command to create a local user and password combination. This allowed the user to log in with normal user access. The attacker then exploited another component of the web UI feature, leveraging the new local user to elevate privilege to root and write the implant to the file system. Cisco has assigned CVE-2023-20273 to this issue. CVE-2023-20198 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 10.0. CVE-2023-20273 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 7.2. Both of these CVEs are being tracked by CSCwh87343.

## CVE-2022-29464
 Certain WSO2 products allow unrestricted file upload with resultant remote code execution. The attacker must use a /fileupload endpoint with a Content-Disposition directory traversal sequence to reach a directory under the web root, such as a ../../../../repository/deployment/server/webapps directory. This affects WSO2 API Manager 2.2.0 up to 4.0.0, WSO2 Identity Server 5.2.0 up to 5.11.0, WSO2 Identity Server Analytics 5.4.0, 5.4.1, 5.5.0 and 5.6.0, WSO2 Identity Server as Key Manager 5.3.0 up to 5.11.0, WSO2 Enterprise Integrator 6.2.0 up to 6.6.0, WSO2 Open Banking AM 1.4.0 up to 2.0.0 and WSO2 Open Banking KM 1.4.0, up to 2.0.0.

## CVE-2021-45046
 It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j 2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java 7) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and disabling JNDI functionality by default.
