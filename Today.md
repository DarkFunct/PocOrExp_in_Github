## CVE-2023-32315
 Openfire is an XMPP server licensed under the Open Source Apache License. Openfire's administrative console, a web-based application, was found to be vulnerable to a path traversal attack via the setup environment. This permitted an unauthenticated user to use the unauthenticated Openfire Setup Environment in an already configured Openfire environment to access restricted pages in the Openfire Admin Console reserved for administrative users. This vulnerability affects all versions of Openfire that have been released since April 2015, starting with version 3.10.0. The problem has been patched in Openfire release 4.7.5 and 4.6.8, and further improvements will be included in the yet-to-be released first version on the 4.8 branch (which is expected to be version 4.8.0). Users are advised to upgrade. If an Openfire upgrade isn&#8217;t available for a specific release, or isn&#8217;t quickly actionable, users may see the linked github advisory (GHSA-gw42-f939-fhvm) for mitigation advice.

## CVE-2022-44268
 ImageMagick 7.1.0-49 is vulnerable to Information Disclosure. When it parses a PNG image (e.g., for resize), the resulting image could have embedded the content of an arbitrary. file (if the magick binary has permissions to read it).

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2017-9248
 Telerik.Web.UI.dll in Progress Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX before R2 2017 SP1 and Sitefinity before 10.0.6412.0 does not properly protect Telerik.Web.UI.DialogParametersEncryptionKey or the MachineKey, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms, leading to a MachineKey leak, arbitrary file uploads or downloads, XSS, or ASP.NET ViewState compromise.
