## CVE-2023-24065
 NOSH 4a5cfdb allows stored XSS via the create user page. For example, a first name (of a physician, assistant, or billing user) can have a JavaScript payload that is executed upon visiting the /users/2/1 page. This may allow attackers to steal Protected Health Information because the product is for health charting.

## CVE-2023-24055
 ** DISPUTED ** KeePass through 2.53 (in a default installation) allows an attacker, who has write access to the XML configuration file, to obtain the cleartext passwords by adding an export trigger. NOTE: the vendor's position is that the password database is not intended to be secure against an attacker who has that level of access to the local PC.

## CVE-2021-23434
 This affects the package object-path before 0.11.6. A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2020-15256 when the path components used in the path parameter are arrays. In particular, the condition currentPath === '__proto__' returns false if currentPath is ['__proto__']. This is because the === operator returns always false when the type of the operands is different.

## CVE-2021-3634
 A flaw has been found in libssh in versions prior to 0.9.6. The SSH protocol keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the session. One of them is called secret_hash and the other session_id. Initially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange, previous session_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash. Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based on hash of different size, eventually creating &quot;secret_hash&quot; of different size than the session_id has. This becomes an issue when the session_id memory is zeroed or when it is used again during second key re-exchange.

## CVE-2020-15256
 A prototype pollution vulnerability has been found in `object-path` &lt;= 0.11.4 affecting the `set()` method. The vulnerability is limited to the `includeInheritedProps` mode (if version &gt;= 0.11.0 is used), which has to be explicitly enabled by creating a new instance of `object-path` and setting the option `includeInheritedProps: true`, or by using the default `withInheritedProps` instance. The default operating mode is not affected by the vulnerability if version &gt;= 0.11.0 is used. Any usage of `set()` in versions &lt; 0.11.0 is vulnerable. The issue is fixed in object-path version 0.11.5 As a workaround, don't use the `includeInheritedProps: true` options or the `withInheritedProps` instance if using a version &gt;= 0.11.0.
