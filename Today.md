## CVE-2023-35843
 NocoDB through 0.106.0 (or 0.109.1) has a path traversal vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to access arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the path parameter of the /download route. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to access sensitive files and data on the server, including configuration files, source code, and other sensitive information.

## CVE-2023-2982
 The WordPress Social Login and Register (Discord, Google, Twitter, LinkedIn) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 7.6.4. This is due to insufficient encryption on the user being supplied during a login validated through the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they know the email address associated with that user. This was partially patched in version 7.6.4 and fully patched in version 7.6.5.

## CVE-2022-24715
 Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework and command-line interface. Authenticated users, with access to the configuration, can create SSH resource files in unintended directories, leading to the execution of arbitrary code. This issue has been resolved in versions 2.8.6, 2.9.6 and 2.10 of Icinga Web 2. Users unable to upgrade should limit access to the Icinga Web 2 configuration.

## CVE-2021-44731
 A race condition existed in the snapd 2.54.2 snap-confine binary when preparing a private mount namespace for a snap. This could allow a local attacker to gain root privileges by bind-mounting their own contents inside the snap's private mount namespace and causing snap-confine to execute arbitrary code and hence gain privilege escalation. Fixed in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04 and 2.54.3+21.10.1

## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2021-3864
 A flaw was found in the way the dumpable flag setting was handled when certain SUID binaries executed its descendants. The prerequisite is a SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in the current directory with uid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation of privileges.

## CVE-2019-9053
 An issue was discovered in CMS Made Simple 2.2.8. It is possible with the News module, through a crafted URL, to achieve unauthenticated blind time-based SQL injection via the m1_idlist parameter.
