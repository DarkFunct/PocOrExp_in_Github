## CVE-2021-41773
 A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

## CVE-2018-9995
 TBK DVR4104 and DVR4216 devices, as well as Novo, CeNova, QSee, Pulnix, XVR 5 in 1, Securus, Night OWL, DVR Login, HVR Login, and MDVR Login, which run re-branded versions of the original TBK DVR4104 and DVR4216 series, allow remote attackers to bypass authentication via a &quot;Cookie: uid=admin&quot; header, as demonstrated by a device.rsp?opt=user&amp;cmd=list request that provides credentials within JSON data in a response.
